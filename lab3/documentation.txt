Representation:
I chose to implement a hash table for storing the identifiers and constants in the symbol table.
We assume that in a symbol table, the keys are strings. The hash function returns a hash value by converting a string
to an integer value and dividing it by the size of the table. In case of the insertion operation, a rehashing is also
done whenever the load factor is greater than 0.6.

Operations:
- insert(self, key: str):
    pre: the key is a string
    post: the key is inserted in the hash table
- remove(self, key: str):
    pre: the key is a string
    post: the key is removed from the hash table
- get(self, key: str):
    pre: the key is a string
    post: Returns True if the key exists, otherwise False
